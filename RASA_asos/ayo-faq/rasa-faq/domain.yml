If you find that your promo code isn't working then please check the below:
 
You can only use one discount/promo code per order. This applies to our free delivery codes too.\n
Discount/promo codes cannot be used for gift vouchers or for any delivery charges.
As our discount/promo codes vary so do the terms and conditions of each, so make sure you check when you receive any codes. Codes may only be valid for certain items and the majority of codes will have an expiry date. You should be able to find the terms and conditions in the same place you found the code whether it be through an email or on our website. Check out our [Ts&Cs](http://www.asos.com/infopages/pgetandc.aspx) for more information.
Some codes will only work for specific people or for specific countries. The terms and conditions will state if the code can only be used in a certain country. If you've received the code in an email from ASOS then the code may also be locked to that email address. Make sure you're trying to use the code using your ASOS account that has the same email address as we sent the code to. \n
If your discount code is still not working after checking all of the above, then please get in touch with our Customer Care Team so we can help you further."

  utter_faq/carbon_emissions:
  - text: "We split our delivery emissions into three main sections: travel from our suppliers to our fulfilment centre; delivery from our fulfilment centre to our customers; and finally, returns from our customers back to us. Together, these three sections account for around 90% of our operational emissions, and all of the emissions associated with our deliveries. We’re working hard to reduce our impact in this area, including by scaling up our use of electric vehicles – read more here. \n
\n
What is ASOS doing about its carbon footprint? \n
In 2015 we launched our ‘Carbon 2020’ strategy, which outlined how we planned to reduce carbon intensity – grams of carbon dioxide per customer order – every year until 2020. Carbon 2020 focussed on six key areas: reducing emissions relating to our customer deliveries and returns; order packaging; energy efficiency; reducing energy consumption; and switching to renewable energy sources. Carbon 2020 came to a close this year, and we’re incredibly proud to have achieved a 30% reduction in carbon intensity per customer order since 2015. \n
Since 2012, we’ve also been part of the UK’s Sustainable Clothing Action Plan, helping us keep track of the waste, water and carbon associated with the production of clothing that we sold in the UK. As a signatory to the programme, we pledged to cut 15% of our water and carbon use and 3.5% of our waste generation by 2021, against a 2012 baseline. We’ve already made great progress against our targets, with  a 20% reduction in carbon use, thanks to switching our fibres to more sustainable alternatives; a 4% reduction in waste, driven by our increased uptake of recycled fibres; and a 10% reduction in water use, all against a 2012 baseline. \n
\n
We’re currently in the process of setting new targets and a new strategy for tackling our carbon footprint, and we’re looking forward to sharing more information on this as soon as we can."
 
  utter_faq/delivery_customs:
  - text: "In most cases, any customs or import duties are charged once the parcel reaches its destination country. \n
You may be charged for handling fees and taxes as your order passes through customs. Any charges on a parcel must be paid by the person receiving the parcel (this also applies to retail & wholesale customers). \n
ASOS has no control over these charges and we can't tell you what the cost would be, as customs policies and import duties vary widely from country to country. \n
It might be a good idea to contact your local customs office for current charges before you order, so you are not surprised by charges you were not expecting."
